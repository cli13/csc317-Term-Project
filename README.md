# CSC413-Term-Project
SFSU final project (Bee Game) 2019

This is the 2nd part (game) of the final project for CSC413 Software Development where I enhanced understanding of code reusability by writing code from part 1 that will work with part 2.

This is a 2D java game where the player is controlling multiple bees using the same control. The objective for the player is to nagivate all the bees to their beehives while avoiding obstacles.

Controls: 
All bees are controlled using WASD
